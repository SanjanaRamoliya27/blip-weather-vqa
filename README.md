# Image EDA & Visual Question Answering (VQA)

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on images to assess quality,
resolution, blur, and perceptual similarity. It also integrates a BLIP-based
Visual Question Answering (VQA) model to answer natural language questions about images.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `EDA.ipynb` – Image exploratory data analysis
- `App.ipynb` – Gradio-based interactive UI for EDA + VQA

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- Pillow
- Gradio
- Hugging Face Transformers (BLIP)
- Google Colab

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `App.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Install required libraries
3. Run all cells
4. Use the Gradio public link to interact with the app

## 📊 Key Features
- Image size & aspect ratio analysis
- Blur detection for quality assessment
- Perceptual hashing for duplicate detection
- BLIP-based Visual Question Answering
- Clean, no-scroll Gradio UI
